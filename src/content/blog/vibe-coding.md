I have thoughts on so-called "vibe coding," where the AI agents do all of the heavy lifting. Some folks talk about it as being a slop generator, but that hasn't
been my experience at all. When the AI is in the groove, it can crank out some really solid code that just needs human supervision and a bit of polish.

The key is keeping the context tight and the prompts clear. When I set up the environment right, vibe coding feels more like a jam session than a chore.
The AI handles the repetitive stuff, freeing me up to focus on the creative aspects of development. It's a different rhythm, but one that can be really productive
when done right.
