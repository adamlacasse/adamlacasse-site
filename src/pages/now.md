# Now

A quick snapshot of what I’m focused on these days — professionally, creatively, and intellectually.

> **Last updated:** January 2026

## Building

- **This portfolio (Astro)** — tightening the design, writing clear content, and keeping things fast + simple.
- **Freq Show** — a music-nerd project for exploring artists, albums, credits, and discographies with great UX and clean data modeling.

## Learning

- **CS fundamentals** (discrete math / algorithms) — sharpening the “why” behind the day-to-day engineering work.
- **System design & architecture** — especially boundaries, maintainability, and how teams evolve code over time.

## Working style

- I like projects with real users, clear outcomes, and a feedback loop.
- I bias toward boring technology, clean interfaces, and shipping improvements in small slices.
- I care a lot about naming, structure, and leaving things easier than I found them.

## Current curiosities

- Practical patterns for “low-drama” microservices and platform evolution
- Search relevance and information architecture (especially in music metadata)
- Simple ways to measure product impact without drowning in dashboards

## Outside of code

- Music deep-dives (credits, sessions, and liner-note rabbit holes)
- Cooking and tinkering with tools around the house
- Finding the simplest solution that’s still a joy to use
