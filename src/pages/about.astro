  <p class="page-intro">
    I've been a full stack software engineer since 2018. Before the career change that led me to
    software I was on "the business side," solving problems by turning down the noise around complex
    issues and building relationships with key people. Although I am now a software engineer, I am
    acutely aware that technology is often the last step in the process - not the first.

    Since 2000 I have been working with people and processes to extract maximum value with minimum
    cost and effort. I've consistently used that approach to drive profitability in the real estate,
    professional services, and insurance industries. The products change, but the winning formula is
    the same.

    In the day to day, I am passionate about fostering great teams. I am NOT a "super chicken" and I
    fully subscribe to the philosophy that collaboration and "social capital" ultimately create
    significantly better business and personal outcomes than intra-team competition. I am lucky to
    have been on and lead some great teams over the years, and zero of those had "brilliant jerks"
    or the like. The recipe was simply respect, support, and communication.
