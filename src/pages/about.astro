  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I've been a full stack software engineer since 2018. Before the career change that led me to
    software, I spent years on the "business side," solving problems by turning down the noise
    around complex issues and building strong relationships with the right people. Although I am now
    a software engineer, I am acutely aware that technology is often the last step in the process —
    not the first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since 2000, I have worked with people and processes to extract maximum value with minimum cost
    and effort. I've consistently used that approach to drive outcomes across the real estate,
    professional services, and insurance industries. The products change, but the winning formula is
    the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the day to day, I care deeply about fostering healthy, effective teams. I am NOT a "super
    chicken," and I fully subscribe to the idea that collaboration and social capital consistently
    produce better business and personal outcomes than internal competition. The best teams I’ve
    been part of — and led — were built on respect, support, and clear communication. None relied on
    "brilliant jerks."
  </p>

  <h2>Master’s program</h2>

  <p>
    I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial
    Intelligence at <a href="https://www.merrimack.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
      >Merrimack College</a
    >. I am deepening my understanding of the theoretical foundations behind everyday engineering
    decisions. The goal isn’t credentialing — it’s developing better judgment by understanding the
    tradeoffs beneath the abstractions. And, as we all know, AI isn't going away anytime soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    My focus areas include algorithms, discrete mathematics, data modeling, and system design. I’m
    particularly interested in how formal concepts translate into real-world software: complexity,
    constraints, boundaries, and long-term maintainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    One concrete output of that work is <a href="https://northflow.adamlacasse.dev">NorthFlow</a> — a
    small, intentionally scoped check-in app in Python that emphasizes database design, constraints, and
    extensibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Tech I work with</h2>

  <p>
    I tend to work across the full stack, with a bias toward boring, well-understood tools that
    scale with teams and time. I value clarity, explicit boundaries, and systems that are easy to
    reason about long after the initial implementation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Frontend</strong> — TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Angular, modern HTML & CSS
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Backend</strong> — Node.js, Java (Spring Boot), Python (Flask), RESTful APIs
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data</strong> — PostgreSQL, MySQL, relational modeling, constraints, migrations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Infrastructure & tooling</strong> — AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines, Git & GitHub
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When choosing tools, I optimize for long-term maintainability, ease of ownership, and clear
    interfaces over novelty or cleverness.
  </p>

  <h2>Selected experience</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve spent my career working at the intersection of business problems and technical systems,
    across both non-technical and engineering roles.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Senior Full Stack Software Engineer — Insurance & enterprise platforms</strong><br />
      Building and evolving internal tools used by large, distributed teams, with an emphasis on maintainability,
      clear ownership, and incremental delivery.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Business & operations leadership — Real estate and professional services</strong><br
      />
      Led operational initiatives focused on process improvement, cost control, and cross-functional collaboration
      prior to transitioning into software engineering.
    </li>
  </ul>
