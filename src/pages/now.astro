    A snapshot of what I’m actively focused on these days — not a résumé, just what has my attention
    right now.

  <h2>Building</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>This portfolio (Astro)</strong> — refining structure, tightening copy, and keeping the site
      fast, readable, and low-maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Freq Show</strong> — a music-nerd project exploring artists, albums, credits, and discographies
      with an emphasis on clean data modeling and humane UX.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>NorthFlow</strong> — a small, intentionally scoped check-in app built as part of my CS coursework,
      with a focus on database design, constraints, and long-term extensibility.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Computer science fundamentals</strong> — discrete math, algorithms, and the theory that
      explains <em>why</em> everyday engineering tradeoffs work (or don’t).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>System design & architecture</strong> — especially boundaries, evolution over time, and
      how teams keep codebases understandable as they grow.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I like to work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I’m drawn to projects with real users, clear outcomes, and feedback loops.</li>
    <li>
      I bias toward boring technology, explicit interfaces, and shipping improvements in small,
      reversible slices.
    </li>
    <li>
      I care deeply about naming, structure, and leaving systems easier to reason about than I found
      them.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current curiosities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Low-drama approaches to microservices and platform evolution</li>
    <li>Search relevance and information architecture (especially in music metadata)</li>
    <li>Ways to measure product impact without drowning teams in dashboards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outside of code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Music deep dives — credits, sessions, liner notes, and side-player rabbit holes</li>
    <li>Cooking and practical tinkering around the house</li>
    <li>Finding the simplest solution that’s still a joy to use</li>
  </ul>
