    A quick snapshot of what I'm focused on these days — professionally, creatively, and
    intellectually.

  <h2>Building</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>This portfolio (Astro)</strong> — tightening the design, writing clear content, and keeping
      things fast + simple.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Freq Show</strong> — a music-nerd project for exploring artists, albums, credits, and discographies
      with great UX and clean data modeling.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>CS fundamentals</strong> (discrete math / algorithms) — sharpening the "why" behind the
      day-to-day engineering work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>System design & architecture</strong> — especially boundaries, maintainability, and how
      teams evolve code over time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Working style</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I like projects with real users, clear outcomes, and a feedback loop.</li>
    <li>
      I bias toward boring technology, clean interfaces, and shipping improvements in small slices.
    </li>
    <li>I care a lot about naming, structure, and leaving things easier than I found them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Current curiosities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Practical patterns for "low-drama" microservices and platform evolution</li>
    <li>Search relevance and information architecture (especially in music metadata)</li>
    <li>Simple ways to measure product impact without drowning in dashboards</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outside of code</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Music deep-dives (credits, sessions, and liner-note rabbit holes)</li>
    <li>Cooking and tinkering with tools around the house</li>
    <li>Finding the simplest solution that's still a joy to use</li>
  </ul>
